# 9_10_Super-Hero-Sightings
Full-stack website using Spring MVC framework and MySQL, all based on CRUD, that allows the user to input, delete, edit, and view hero and sighting details

**Before cleaning, building, and running be sure to execute MySQL query, SuperHeroSightings.sql. Also, make sure MySQL server passwords match the spring-persitance.xml and test-applicationContext.xml files. The folder to look into is Other Sources and Other Test Sources**

Here are the links to what I had to install on Windows 10 OS:

java jdk, oracle-java8-installer - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

netbeans ide, java ee bundle, lastest version - https://netbeans.org/downloads/

apache tomcat - google and download Tomcat 8.5.11 zip file -- **Make sure you have the server working on Netbeans to run program, not sure if other servers would work or not, never tested it out**

mysql-installer-community-latest version -  **I only needed to install the MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench**
